     The question of life in outer space is becoming exponentially closer to being answered. However, the 
     answer to this question is still dubious. Many people vary beliefs about extra-terrestrial life
     with many arguments for their beliefs. This paper aims to provide information around the question
     of life beyond earth and how various establishments try to answer it, with problems encountered such
     as disputing religion and problems with engineering. One company in particular, NASA, are global
     leaders with reference to searching for extraterrestrial life for many years. They have conducted
     plenty of research methods and hypotheses being tested not only to determine if there is life, but
     also where to look for it to save money. One way in which they determine where to look for 
     extraterrestrial life is that they experiment how life began here on earth and if the conditions on
     other planets are homogenous to earth.

     Life in outer space is a question that many people pondered daily for many decades since the discovery
     of space itself with not much clarity if there will ever be an answer. However, as the years progressed
     the discovery of extraterrestrial life has grown increasingly plausible to society. Many companies aid
     this phenomenon with a main investor being NASA, who in 2003 granted £3 million to the Extraterrestrial
     Intelligence Institute (Seti), based in California to research into the planetary context for life
     (Guardian, 2003). 
        
     Being unsuccessful so far in this search does not necessarily mean that there is no life in the universe.
     It could just be that we have not searched in the correct places yet. However, scientists were quick to
     realise the inefficiency of searching every single planet in the galaxy for intelligent life, due to the
     waste of money if unsuccessful with their findings, the amount of time it may take to search these planets
     and because a lot of scientists have bigger questions to try and answer to further advance human civilisation
     and improve the world. 

     The scientists that research alien life follow a famous equation which enables them to estimate the number of 
     extra-terrestrial civilisations in the Milky Way. This Is called the drake equation; this equation is said
     the be the second most famous equation of all time, behind Einsteins E=mc2 . This highly prestigious equation
     originated from a thought that Drake himself had. This is that you can estimate the number of students at a
     university by multiplying the number of students entering a university each year and then multiplying that 
     with the average number of years that they will stay at university (Sierra, 2016). Similar logic is used within
     the drake equation, however with much less reliability as quantities used in this equation are a rough
     approximation as we cannot find some definitive values, for example ‘L’ which is mean time length for these
     civilisations. Using this method, scientists have been able to calculate that there may be 12,500 intelligent
     alien civilisations currently existing. This shows how pertinent math is when searching for extra-terrestrial 
     life when few people would find the connection between math and aliens. 

     A topic which is likely to go unspoken when dealing with the search for extra-terrestrials are the ethics of this. 
     Questions may arise if we find what we are searching for; Do they have rights? Would it be okay to test them for
     information? Would this discovery cause mayhem among society? These are all ethical questions scientists must
     consider when exploring space. We would need to know more about these aliens to make these ethical judgements.
     Some scientists have proposed the point that forming a relationship with space-life to gain information would be 
     a problem as it may reduce their ‘alien-ness.’ 

     Another integral part to aid the search for extra-terrestrial life is engineering. Engineers need to be able to invent
     machines that will overcome the challenges of looking for any life millions of miles away. A team at NASA’s jet
     propulsion lab in Southern California has developed an incredible gadget like nothing we have seen before. This is 
     called the ocean worlds life surveyor, OWLS for short. What this innovative invention does is that it ingests liquid 
     to then analyse. The vision for this project was that it would look at frozen water from a vapor plume erupting from
     Saturn's moon Enceladus (Pamer an O'Neil, 2022). An extreme problem they face is that the liquid found on a planet has
     certain conditions. Although these conditions can be kept on earth due to scientific equipment, they cannot be kept on
     a spacecraft as it flies back down to earth at incredible speeds. However, they have tried to overcome this by using
     equipment that analyses data in outer space. 

     The only life that has ever been recorded has been on planet earth. Scientists believe that researching into how life on 
     earth started and to understand life itself can help us to see the certain conditions life needs (Howells, 2023). This
     teaches us that we can then look at those planets with similar conditions to earth such as planets within the Goldilocks
     zone, which is a zone where planets within it will be not too hot and not too cold for life. However, a problem these
     scientists have encountered with this way of thinking is that what is to say that other life needs those certain conditions,
     they may need extremely hot temperatures and no water to survive? Nonetheless, considering this issue would be a waste of
     time, this is because if we assume life can develop everywhere we would have to search every crevice on every planet
     . Therefore, institutions such as NASA have concluded that we factually know that life started with earth's conditions so
     the highest chance of finding extra-terrestrial life will be on planets with similar conditions to earth. An imperative to
     carbon-based life is water. Cells use liquid water to turn food into energy and to get rid of waste within us. Knowing this
     fact helps us ascertain that life as we know it would not exist without water. Therefore, by studying the foundations of our
     biology and planets in our solar system, we can hunt for extra-terrestrial life on the most auspicious planets.
