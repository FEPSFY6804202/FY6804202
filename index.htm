      The question of life in outer space is becoming exponentially closer to being answered. However, an
      answer to this question is still absent. Many people vary beliefs about extra-terrestrial life with
      many arguments for their beliefs. This paper will provide information around the question of life 
      beyond earth and how various establishments try to answer it, with problems that they may encounter
      such as disputing religion. One company in particular, NASA, are global leaders with reference to 
      searching for extraterrestrial life for many years. They have plenty of research methods and 
      hypotheses being tested not only to determine if there is life but also where to look for it to
      save money and time. One way in which they determine where to look for extraterrestrial life is that
      they experiment how life began here on earth and if the conditions on other planets are homogenous to earth.

      Life in outer space is a question that many people pondered daily for many decades since the discovery
      of space itself with not much clarity if there will ever be an answer. However, as the years progressed
      the discovery of extraterrestrial life has grown increasingly plausible to society. Many companies aid 
      this phenomenon with a main investor being NASA, who in 2003 granted £3 million to the Extraterrestrial
      Intelligence Institute (Seti), based in California to research into the planetary context for life.

      Being unsuccessful so far in this search does not necessarily mean that there is no life in the universe. 
      It could just be that we have not searched in the correct places yet. However, scientists were quick to
      realise the inefficiency of searching every single planet in the galaxy for intelligent life, due to the
      waste of money if unsuccessful with their findings, the amount of time it may take to search these planets
      and because a lot of scientists have bigger questions to try and answer to further advance human civilisation
      and improve the world. Although, the scientists that do research alien life follow a famous equation which
      enables them to estimate the number of extra-terrestrial civilisations in the milky way.  

      This Is called the drake equation; this equation is said the be the second most famous equation of all time,
      behind Einsteins E=mc2 . This highly prestigious equation originated from a thought that Drake himself had.
      This is that you can estimate the number of students at a university by multiplying the number of students
      entering a university each year and then multiplying that with the average number of years that they will
      stay at university. Similar logic is used within the drake equation, however with much less reliability as
      quantities used in this equation are a rough approximation as we cannot find some definitive values, for
      example ‘L’ which is mean time length for these civilisations. Using this method scientists have been able
      to calculate that there may be 12,500 intelligent alien civilisations currently existing. This shows how
      pertinent math is when searching for extra-terrestrial life when not many people would find the connection
      between math and aliens.
