      The question of life in outer space is becoming exponentially closer to being answered. However, an
      answer to this question is still absent. Many people vary beliefs about extra-terrestrial life with
      many arguments for their beliefs. This paper will provide information around the question of life 
      beyond earth and how various establishments try to answer it, with problems that they may encounter
      such as disputing religion. One company in particular, NASA, are global leaders with reference to 
      searching for extraterrestrial life for many years. They have plenty of research methods and 
      hypotheses being tested not only to determine if there is life but also where to look for it to
      save money and time. One way in which they determine where to look for extraterrestrial life is that
      they experiment how life began here on earth and if the conditions on other planets are homogenous to earth.

      Life in outer space is a question that many people pondered daily for many decades since the discovery
      of space itself with not much clarity if there will ever be an answer. However, as the years progressed
      the discovery of extraterrestrial life has grown increasingly plausible to society. Many companies aid 
      this phenomenon with a main investor being NASA, who in 2003 granted £3 million to the Extraterrestrial
      Intelligence Institute (Seti), based in California to research into the planetary context for life.
